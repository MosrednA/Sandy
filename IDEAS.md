# 💡 Project Ideas & Next Steps

## 1. 🌡️ Thermodynamics Engine
**Goal**: Unified temperature system affecting all materials.
- **Heat Transfer**: Neighbors exchange heat (Lava -> Stone -> Water).
- **State Changes**: Water boils to Steam, Lava cools to Stone.
- **Combustion**: Wood ignites based on temperature threshold, not just contact.
- **Visuals**: Heat-based coloration (glowing glowing metals).

## 2. ⚡ Electricity & Electronics
**Goal**: Logic, circuitry, and powered mechanisms.
- **Materials**: Wire, Battery, Semiconductor, Tesla Coil.
- **Interactions**: Electrified water, ignition of explosives, logic gates (AND/OR).

## 3. 💧 Advanced Fluid Dynamics
**Goal**: Realistic pressure-based flow instead of simple stacking.
- **Pressure**: Liquids equalize horizontally and push upwards in U-tubes.
- **Viscosity**: Distinct flow rates for Honey vs. Water vs. Gas.
- **Mixing**: Miscible vs. immiscible liquid interactions.

## 4. 🧙‍♂️ "The Noita Treatment" (Gameplay)
**Goal**: Transform the toy into a game with an active protagonist.
- **Player Entity**: Wizard/Drone with movement physics (run, jetpack).
- **Tools**: Wands/Guns to spawn particles or dig.
- **Enemies**: AI blobs or creatures that interact with the sand.

## 5. 🧬 Artificial Life
**Goal**: Cellular automata and biological growth.
- **Game of Life**: Conways' rules interactions.
- **Plants**: Roots grow down, stems grow up, flowers bloom.
- **Infection**: Virus material converting organic matter.

## 6. 🔦 Lighting & Atmosphere
**Goal**: Enhanced visual fidelity and immersion.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Fire/Lava cast real light; walls cast shadows.
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Affects visibility and temperature.
- **Refraction**: light bending through Glass/Water.

## 7. 🏗️ Structure & Community
**Goal**: Persistence and sharing.
- **Online Gallery**: Upload/Download saves via the server.
- **Blueprints**: Copy/Paste functionality for complex structures.
